5. Code style and formatting:
   1. A strict `.editorconfig` file defining code style and formatting rules following my personal preferences. Some

   2. [ReSharper tools](https://www.nuget.org/packages/jetbrains.resharper.globaltools) installed for code inspections in
     CI.
6. GitHub Actions workflow including build, test, code inspections and coverage report.
